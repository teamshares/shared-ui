## Release Reminder (delete before submitting PR)
*Consider whether or not you'll need to manually redeploy any consuming apps (e.g. Buyout, OS) as soon as this change is merged.*

**Reminder:** these changes won't be pulled into any downstream apps until you merge _this_ PR, and _then_ merge a PR _on that app_ checking in an updated `yarn.lock` (i.e. after having run `yarn upgrade @teamshares/ui`).
